Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
    - Bitbucket is focused on private repositories and allows to have 5 collaborators for free, while GitHub is a better fit for public repositories.

  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
    - Matthew Roberts, he was trying to get past a mystery exception.

  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
    - Jon Mountjoy who initialised it.

  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
    - The last commit was by Dave Pearce, while the first was made via the same person.


  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
    - Repository B is quite active in comparison to Repository A, which has been inactive for nearly a year. I think Repository A, which goal is to display survey data had achieved their goal outside of bug fixes compared to Repository B which is a a component of a Build Tool, and thus is constantly coming out with new versions.

  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?
    - 



# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints
